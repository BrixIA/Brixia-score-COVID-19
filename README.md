## Datasets

### BrixIA COVID-19 Dataset
The access and use, for research purposes only, of the annotated BrixIA COVID-19 CXR Dataset have been granted form the Ethical Committee of Brescia (Italy) NP4121 (last update 08/07/2020).

**The site from which data can be downloaded is under construction and instructions will follow soon.**


### Annotation and CXR from Cohen's dataset

We exploit the public repository by [Cohen et al.](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) which contains CXR images (We downloaded a copy on May 11th, 2020).

In order to contribute to such public dataset, two expert radiologists, a board-certified staff member and a trainee with 22 and 2 years of experience respectively, produced the related Brixia-score annotations for CXR in this collection, exploiting [labelbox](https://labelbox.com), an online solution for labelling. After discarding problematic cases (e.g., images with a significant portion missing, too small resolution, the impossibility of scoring for external reasons, etc.), the final dataset is composed of 192 CXR, completely annotated according to the Brixia-score system.

 <summary>Scheme</summary>

| Attribute | Description |
|------|-----|
| filename | filename from Cohen dataset |
| from S-A to S-F | The 6 regions annotatated by a Senior radiologist (+20yr expertise), from 0 to 3 
| S-Global | Global score by the Senior radiologist (sum of S-A : S-F),  from 0 to 18
| from J-A to J-F | The 6 regions annotatated by a Junior radiologist (+2yr expertise),  from 0 to 3 
| J-Global | Global score by the Junior radiologist (sum of S-A : S-F),  from 0 to 18
</details>


### Segmentation Dataset
We provide the script to prepare the dataset as described in the Project paper. 

We exploit different segmentation datasets in order to pre-train the extended-Unet module of the proposed architecture. We used the original training/test set splitting when present (as the case of the JSRT database), otherwise we took the first 50 images as test set, and the remaining as training set (see Table below).

|  | Training-set |  Test-set | Split | 
|------|-----|-----|-----|
|[Montgomery County](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/tuberculosis-chest-x-ray-image-data-sets/) | 88           | 50       | first 50 |      
| [Shenzhen Hospital](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01199) | 516          | 50       | first 50 |
| [JSRT database](http://db.jsrt.or.jp/eng.php)     | 124          | 123      | original |
|------|-----|-----|-----|
|Total             | 728           |223      ||
</details>

The data can be downloaded from their respective sites.


### Alignment synthetic dataset
To avoid the inclusion of anatomical parts not belonging to the lungs in the AI pipeline, which would increase the task complexity or introduce unwanted biases, we integrated into the pipeline an alignment block. This exploits a synthetic dataset (used for on-line augmentation) composed of artificially transformed images from the segmentation dataset (see Table below), including random rotations, shifts, and zooms, which is used in the pre-training phase.

The parameters refer to the implementation in Albumentation. In the last column is expressed the probability of the specific transformation being applied.

 <summary>Additional details</summary>

|    | Parameters (up to) | Probability |
|----|-----|-----|
|Rotation | 25 degree  |    0.8  |
|Scale    | 10%          | 0.8   |
|Shift     | 10%           | 0.8 |
|Elastic transformation  | alpha=60, sigma=12  |   0.2   |
|Grid distortion     | steps=5, limit=0.3 |    0.2  |
|Optical distortion     | distort=0.2, shift=0.05    |     0.2   |

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

The provided code is written for Python 3.x. To install the needed requirements run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For the sake of performance, we suggest to install `tensorflow-gpu` in place of the standard CPU version.

Include the `src` folder in your python library path or launch python from that folder.

### Load Cohen dataset with BrixiaScore annotations
```python
from datasets import brixiascore_cohen  as bsc

# Check the docsting for additional info
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = bsc.get_data()
```
### Prepare and load the segmentation dataset

To prepare the segmentation dataset either `Montgomery County`, `Shenzhen Hospital`, and `JSRT` datasets must be
downloaded from their websites and unpacked in a folder (for instance `data/sources/`). Than execute:
```bash
 python3 -m datasets.lung_segmentation  --input_folder data/sources/ --target_size 512
```
or just import it (the first time it is executed, it will create the segmentation dataset):

```python
from datasets import lung_segmentation  as ls

# Check the docsting for additional info. The train-set is provided as a generator, while the validation set is
# preloaded in memory.
# `get_data` accepts a configuration dictionary where you can specify every parameter. See `ls.default_config`
train_gen, (val_imgs, val_masks) = ls.get_data()
```

### Prepare and load the alignment dataset
To prepare the alignment dataset, the segmentation one mush be already built (see previous point)

```python
from datasets import synthetic_alignment  as sa

# Check the docsting for additional info. The train-set and validation-set are provided as generators
# `get_data` accepts a configuration dictionary where you can specify every parameter. See `ls.default_config`
train_gen, val_gen = sa.get_data()
```

### Other steps

Instructions for preparing and loading the Brixia Covid-19 Dataset and the BS-Net will follow (see specific sections for more info).
